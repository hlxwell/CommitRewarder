# Commit Rewarder

## Introduction

The Commit Rewarder is a tool that allows developers to score code contributions using a machine learning model like ChatGPT and provide rewards based on the score. The Action is designed to provide developers with immediate feedback on the quality of their code contributions and to incentivize them to make high-quality contributions on an ongoing basis.

The Action works by extracting the commit message from the code contribution and using it as input to the machine learning model. The model generates a score, which is used to determine the reward. The developer is then notified of the score and the reward amount.

The Commit Rewarder could be used by individual developers, teams, or organizations to incentivize high-quality code contributions. The use of machine learning models like ChatGPT provides an objective measure of code quality that can be used to provide feedback and encourage improvements. The Action could be customized to provide different levels of rewards based on the score, and could be integrated with other tools and platforms to streamline the code contribution and reward process.

Overall, the Commit Rewarder is a powerful tool for incentivizing high-quality code contributions and encouraging collaboration among developers.
